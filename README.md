# Cloudflare Pages demo app 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setting up locally

1. Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory. Add this line of code `REACT_APP_CUSTOM_MESSAGE="Local environment"` into the file.
2. In the project directory, you can run:
    * `npm start` - Thsi runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.You will also see any lint errors in the console.
    * `npm run build` - This builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
